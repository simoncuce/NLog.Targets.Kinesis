# NLog.Targets.Kinesis
This project is an NLog Target that connects to AWS Kinesis.

This is in Alpha. Testing to be completed 

[![GoogleAnalyticsTracker Nightly Build Status](https://www.myget.org/BuildSource/Badge/googleanalyticstracker?identifier=22c7cb16-bd83-4e97-8c33-2f5f366f0796)](https://www.myget.org/gallery/googleanalyticstracker)

## Purpose

AWS Kinesis is a high volume enabled data streaming service.
To quote from the [AWS site](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/)

> Amazon Kinesis Streams enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data for specialized needs. Amazon Kinesis Streams can continuously capture and store terabytes of data per hour from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events. 

NLog is one of the most popular and powerful .NET logging tools available. [NLog](http://nlog-project.org/)

The purpose of this project is to provide an out of box Nuget packake containing a ready made Target for uploading Log information to Kinesis.

## How to Install
